##Project Description

This project is to collect data and prepare a tidy data set for later analysis from the experiment data of human activity recognition using smartphones data set. More information about the experiments can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

##Raw Data Collection

The data for this project is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The folder includes the following data sets that are being used:
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activityLabels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample for training and test set respectively. Its range is from 1 to 30.

## Description on how to create the tidy data file 

1.	Download the above data and unzip to working directory.
2.	Load the activity labels in 'activityLabels.txt' and features in 'features.txt' and assign the value to variables 'activityLabels' and 'featureNames'. 
3.	Select only mean and standard deviation in variable 'featureNames' using ‘grep’ function, and assign to variable 'columnsWithMeanSTD'.
4.	Load the data in files ‘X_train.txt’, ‘y_train.txt', ‘X_test.txt', ‘y_test.txt' 'subject_train.txt' and 'subject_test.txt' to variables 'featuresTrain', 'activityTrain', 'featuresTest', 'activityTest', 'subjectTrain' and 'subjectTest'. 
5.	Use function ‘rbind’ to merge “train” and “test” into 'subject', 'activity' and 'features'.
6.	Use function ‘cbind’ to combine 'subject', 'activity' and 'features' to create variable 'extractedData'.
7.	Use function ‘gsub’ to replace ‘-‘ with ‘_’ and remove ‘()’ in column 2 of “columnsWithMeanSTD”. Rename column names in “extractedData” to ‘subject’, ‘activity’ and features in 'columnsWithMeanSTD' column 2. 
8.	Use ‘factor’ function to name the activity column in “extractedData” using the descriptive activity names in 'activityLabels'. 
9.	To take the average of each variable in “extractedData” for each activity and each subject, use ‘aggregate’ function and FUN = mean and get a new tidy data set ‘Tidy’. Rename the first two columns of ‘Tidy’ to ‘subject’ and ‘activity’. Write the output to ‘Tidy.txt’ in working directory. 

## Descriptions of new variables

activityLabels: link class labels with their activity name
features: list of all features
columnsWithMeanSTD: feactures containing mean (‘mean’)and standard deviation(‘std’)
extractedData: merged data set including both train and test
Tidy: summary data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
